This project was made to [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) and bootstraped with [expo](https://expo.io/).

*"For the Flashcards Mobile project, you'll build a mobile app (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study a collection of flashcards. With the app, users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and make the quizes in these decks."*

## Installing dependencies
You can install all project's dependencies with:
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Running our application
You must have the expo cli installed on your machine to run the project
### `yarn global add expo-cli` or `npm install -g expo-cli`

Then you can run with the command:
### `expo start`

Once you've run this command, your browser will open a GUI with some options.
You can run the app on your phone with the expo application that you can download on your phone's store as soon as you are on the same network you run the project. The second option is to run alongside an emulator (on the GUI opened on your browser you will see these options).
