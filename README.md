This project was made to [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

*"For the Flashcards Mobile project, you'll build a mobile app (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study a collection of flashcards. With the app, users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and make the quizes in these decks."*

Then you can run with the command:

You have 2 options to run the app, you can download the expo application on the app store or the play store and you will notice you have the application shown on your homescreen, as soon as you are on the same network you run the project.
